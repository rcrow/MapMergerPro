# MapMergerPro

Map Merger tool - tested using ArcPro 3.0

Written by Ryan Crow, USGS

This tool was created to aid in the compilation of GEMS-structured geologic map databases into a single compiled map. The tools are documented in Arc so please use the "Tool Help" side bar. The ArcMap repo contains DEMO files and outputs that are correctly formatted for experimentation and to facilitate correct usage.
